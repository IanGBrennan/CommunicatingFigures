# Communicating Figures
This is a short (1.5 day) workshop on how we as scientists can create visuals that better communicate our science, either to our peers or to a broader audience. The course will include some basic discussion of color and design, but will mainly focus on using Adobe Illustrator to make cool figures or accents, and how we can create animated (.gif) and interactive plots. This iteration of the workshop has been designed for [Dave Chapple's](https://www.chapplelab.com/) lab group at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/biological-sciences/staff/chapple).

# Communicating Figures
This is a short (1.5 day) workshop on how we as scientists can create visuals that better communicate our science, either to our peers or to a broader audience. The course includes some basic discussion of color and design, but mainly focuses on using Adobe Illustrator to make cool figures or accents, and how we can create animated (.gif) and interactive plots. This iteration of the workshop has been designed for [Dave Chapple's](https://www.chapplelab.com/) lab group at [Monash University](https://www.monash.edu/science/schools/biological-sciences/staff/chapple). 

# Outline and Materials
The basic format includes 6 interactive tutorials that are accompanied by hands-on exercises. Conceivably you could run through all this information on your own (and I encourage you to), but you won't get the full effect without my silky-smooth voice. 

Each activity is included in its own folder (01-06), which includes all the files required to replicate the exercise. I've designed it all in RMarkdown, and exported it as html files, so when you open a folder you can open the html in a browser and follow along, or open the markdown file (.Rmd) and go through there taking notes as you go.
